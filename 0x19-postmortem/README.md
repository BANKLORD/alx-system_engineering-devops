# Issue Summary:


# Duration of Outage:

Start Time: April  13, 2024, 10:00 AM UTC
End Time: April 13, 2024, 12:30 PM UTC
Duration: Approximately 2.5 hours

# Impact:
The outage affected the user authentication service, causing users to experience login failures and inability to access secure areas of the application. Approximately 30% of users were unable to log in during the outage.

# Root Cause:
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the authentication microservice, causing it to lose connectivity with the user database.

# Timeline:
10:00 AM UTC: Issue detected as users reported login failures.

10:10 AM UTC: Monitoring system alerts triggered due to increased error rates.

10:15 AM UTC: Engineers began investigating the issue, focusing on networking and database connectivity.

10:30 AM UTC: Initial assumption made that the database server was experiencing issues.

10:45 AM UTC: Database server health checks showed no anomalies. Investigation shifted to microservice connectivity.

11:00 AM UTC: Misleading assumption that a recent deployment might have caused the issue led to rollback attempts.

11:30 AM UTC: Incident escalated to the backend services team for deeper analysis.

12:00 PM UTC: Root cause identified as misconfiguration in the authentication microservice.

12:30 PM UTC: Issue resolved by updating the microservice configuration and restoring connectivity with the database.


# Root Cause and Resolution:

The issue stemmed from an incorrect environment variable setting in the authentication microservice configuration, causing it to point to the wrong database instance. This led to authentication failures during user login attempts. The problem was resolved by updating the configuration to point to the correct database instance, restoring normal service operation.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures:


# Improvements/Fixes:

Enhance monitoring to detect misconfigurations in critical services.
Implement automated testing for microservice configurations during deployment pipelines.
Conduct regular audits of environment variables and service dependencies.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Implement stricter validation checks for environment variables in microservice configurations.
Update documentation to ensure consistency in deployment procedures.
Conduct post-incident review with the team to identify lessons learned and update incident response procedures.
